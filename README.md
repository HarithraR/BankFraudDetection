# BankFraudDetection
To detect fraud, five methodologies were employed:

1.  K-Means Clustering: Identifies anomalies based on distance from centroids.
2.  Z-Score Analysis: Flags extreme outliers in numeric features.
3.  DBSCAN Analysis: Detects density-based anomalies as noise points.
4.  Logistic Regression: Classifies transactions as fraud or non-fraud using supervised learning.
5.  Isolation Forest: Highlights anomalous transactions using tree-based partitioning.
