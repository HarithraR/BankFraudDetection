# BankFraudDetection
To detect fraud, five methodologies were employed:

K-Means Clustering: Identifies anomalies based on distance from centroids.
Z-Score Analysis: Flags extreme outliers in numeric features.
DBSCAN Analysis: Detects density-based anomalies as noise points.
Logistic Regression: Classifies transactions as fraud or non-fraud using supervised learning.
Isolation Forest: Highlights anomalous transactions using tree-based partitioning.
